# VeloMag-Montpellier

## :book: Description :

The goal of this project is to create a mobile application that will help people to find the nearest station to take a VeloMag bike and other stuff in Montpellier.

*In reality, there is another application named [M'Ticket TaM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tam_way.mobiletickets&hl=fr&gl=US) that does the same but objectively the app is horrible to use and does not have the same **insane** features that VeloMag2.0 has !*

## :construction_worker: Architecture of the repo:

The repository is divided in 2 parts:
- The **mobile app** part
- The **report broken bike** part divided in 3 parts:
    - a website to visualize all the broken bikes
    - an API to handle the broken bikes
    - a SQL database to store the broken bikes
